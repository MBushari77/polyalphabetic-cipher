# polyalphabetic-cipher
to run this code you should write the plain text or the cipher text in the input.txt file
then you should run the code and choose encrypt or dcrypt
after that the out put will written in the output.txt file.
so if you encrypt a text you should copy the cipher text to input.txt


you can run 'poly_with_cli.py' to encrypt and decrypt text using Terminal
 
#Note You can't add any symblos to the text, it's not supported
thanks!!!
